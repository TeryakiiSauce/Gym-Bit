# Gym Bit - Workout App ReadMe
For the app's demonstration we decided that we wanted the app to be in Dark mode by default as it looked good for the eye and more appealing. 

## Changes
_Albaraa:_
1. Removed notification switch from the settings page since it was an extra feature and we cancelled it.
2. Added age slider in settings because I discovered that if the user skipped the quiz and saved the data from the settings
instead of the quiz he will never set his name (he can't). 

_Abdulaziz:_
* Generate Function
    1. Created a fully function and dynamic random exercises generator that the user can choose what type of exercise the user wants 

* Create Function
    1. Couldn't make the swipe to delete to look exactly like the mock as it was slightly different

* Made fully modular custom popups that come from one page and display different popups depending on what button is clicked 
* Added a confirm popup for clear schedule 
* Made the update name popup recognise if the name is empty or its been used and promts the user

_Yusuf:_     
In the Exercise Details Page, the Description and Tips label titles have been moved to stick closer to the top. The reason behind it is that it looks clearer for the user instead of it being so close to the actual text and squeezed in.

_Elias:_    
Have removed the "playsCounter" sort which should have sorted the schedules array based on the number of times they have been played because. Moreover, The "average total time" has also been removed because time was running out.

_Ali:_
